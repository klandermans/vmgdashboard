# Dashboard Production Demo

This folder is a small static snapshot of the original `dashboard-production` project. It contains only front-end assets and a few example campaigns stored in JSON files.

Open `index.html` to view a table of campaigns. The page includes a small sidebar menu and filters to switch between all, direct and deal campaigns. `graphs.html` shows two example charts rendered with Chart.js. All data is loaded from the `data.json` and `chart-data.json` files.

Fonts are not included; copy your own WOFF files into `style/fonts` if you need them.

You can serve the demo from any static web server or directly via GitHub Pages.
